# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

Bookcamp Prework Study Guide is a learning tool that was created to help me and other students learn to build a wepage from start to deployment. Using Visual Studio Code and Git hub throughout the prework project we learned to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Github.  This was a project to introduce someone to coding.  It should help people learn the basics of coding that  and give them access to tips and notes taken along the way.  This wasn't the easiest to learn but with repetition and time, most should be able to pick up on coding.  This guide should give someone an idea of what someone with no experience can do with after learning the basics of coding.
